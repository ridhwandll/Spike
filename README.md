Welcome to the **LightEngine**'s source code!<br/>
Its basically an application making engine written in **C++**<br/>
This can also be used an powerful **GameEngine**!<br/>

## :wrench: Project Setup :wrench:
### Windows
- Premake
    - Visual Studio 2019 is recommended on Windows<br/>
    - Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FahimFuad/LightEngine.git` to clone along with the submodules. If you have already cloned and you want to initialize the submodules, type `git submodule init` and to update the submodules type `git submodule update` in your project directory.
    - Run the `GenProjects-windows.bat` file inside the scripts folder and Premake will generate project files for Visual Studio 2019.
    - If you want to generate for other IDE or versions of Visual Studio then in the project directory run your favourite premake [action](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake#using-premake-to-generate-project-files)
    - Once premake generate the project files then you can hit the run button and make the engine up and running!<br/>
- CMake
    - Coming Soon!
### Mac & Linux
- Premake
    - Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FahimFuad/LightEngine.git` to clone along with the submodules. If you have already cloned and you want to initialize the submodules, type `git submodule init` and to update the submodules type `git submodule update` in your project directory.
    - To genereate the project files for your IDE, select the actions of the premake and run them in the project directory. A list of actions of the premake can be found [here](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake#using-premake-to-generate-project-files)
    - The engine is now ready to light!
- CMake
    - Coming Soon!
