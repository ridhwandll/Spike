# LightEngine
Welcome to the **LightEngine**'s source code!<br/>
Its basically an application making engine written in **C++**<br/>
This can also be used an powerful **GameEngine**!<br/>

## :wrench: Project Setup :wrench:
- This Project uses `Premake` as its build system (`CMake` will be added later)<br/>
- Visual Studio 2019 is recommended in Windows<br/>
- Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FahimFuad/LightEngine.git` to clone along with the submodules. If you have already cloned and you want to initialize the submodules, type `git submodule init` and to update the submodules type `git submodule update` in your project directory.
- To genereate the project files for your IDE, select the actions of the premake and run them in the project directory. A list of actions of the premake can be found [here](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake)
- Once premake generate the project files then you can hit the run button and make the engine up and running!<br/>

## Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded   later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
- Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Robust Artificial Intelligence system
- Audio system

### Pull Requests are welcome
This engine is inspired from **TheCherno's** [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) Engine.
